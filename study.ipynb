    "The literature on the subject seems to be quite poor. I was able to find some studies about the intraday volume in the stock market. The way they operate and interpret the data is interesting, but totally irrelevant considering crypto, as the stock market has an open and a close time. \n",
    "Even if this is not relevant for crypto, those open and close times seem to be moments of bigger activity on the market, that could be a starting assumption that we will try to verify in that study. I also found a paper analysing the link between volume and return in the intra day crypto market.\n",
